    "The partnership and proposal from the proposer may be declined for various reasons, such as being similar or identical to a business already underway within Maple Corporation, or a proposal that came in first from a third party, or if the business direction or partnership conditions do not match at the time of review.",
    "Therefore, please provide only information that can be publicly disclosed to our company. We ask for your understanding that we have no obligations such as compensation or responses to the proposer in case of a rejection.",
    "Please do not include in the proposal any trade secrets, confidential matters, or business ideas that you believe need protection.",
    "However, the proposal registration number will be retained for one month, the same as personal information, so that the proposer can check the progress of the partnership proposal. Except for the 'desired partnership site' and 'type of partnership' used for statistics, all other information will be discarded immediately after the retention period. Also, if the proposer requests to re-register the partnership proposal but does not revise or supplement the content within 30 days, the proposal will be discarded.",
    "Moreover, for partnership requests that require the disclosure or sharing of intellectual property rights such as patents, designs, and copyrights, please make sure to take necessary measures to protect your rights before requesting a partnership with us. The partnership proposal content and related materials will be used only for the purpose of reviewing the partnership and will be immediately discarded if the proposal is not accepted."
